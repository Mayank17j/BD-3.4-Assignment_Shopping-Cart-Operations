Shopping Cart Operations

Objective
Previously we created a cart page for FlipDeal where we dealt with various API calls to calculate the cart amount based on various factors. Now expecting to also give its customers the ability to add items to the cart, edit the quantity, delete items, and also read the current state of the cart page.

They have added some new items to their Product Listing Page:
Laptop
Mobile
Tablet

let cart = [
{ productId: 1, name: 'Laptop', price: 50000, quantity: 1 },
{ productId: 2, name: 'Mobile', price: 20000, quantity: 2 }
];

Note: Donâ€™t forget to add:
let cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
